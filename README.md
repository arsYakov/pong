# Pong

### Project Goal

The goal for this project was to create something simple in JavaScript to learn the sytax of the language.

I thought it would be fun to remake one of the first video games ever made. Those guys did a better job than I did, as mine is full of bugs (and technically the player cannot win right now), but it was good to learn. 

You might note the name of the repo mentions powers. Initially I had thought it would be cool to implement powers into pong - and I may come back to this at some point - but currently I am over trying to bug fix the collision system.
